# QCM App

Welcome to the QCM App, an engaging Quiz application developed with React.js.

## Overview

The QCM App is designed to deliver an interactive and educational experience. It allows users to participate in quizzes containing multiple-choice questions. This app harnesses the power of React hooks for efficient state management and employs "props drilling" to seamlessly pass data between components.

## Key Features

- **React Hooks:** Explore the versatility of React hooks, which facilitate concise state management and dynamic updates.

- **Props Drilling:** Efficiently share data across different components, enhancing the flow of information within the app.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js:** The fundamental framework driving this application.
- **React Hooks:** For streamlined state management, making the application highly reactive.
- **react-bootstrap:** React-Bootstrap replaces the Bootstrap JavaScript. Each component has been built from scratch as a true React component, without unneeded dependencies like jQuery.
- **CSS:** For sleek, responsive, and visually appealing styling.
